# React Navbar using React-router
<br>
## About
Some Boilerplate code for a React router-based navbar I made for easy plug into any web page, to save any React developer some time when wanting to make a simple Navbar using React Router.

Main features are:

1. Animated Slide (Credit below)
2. Close Burger menu on changing the link/clicking on the content
3. In the `navbar.css` easily change colour variable values and the navbar style will change.
<br><br><br>
## How to run
1. Make sure that you have Node.js and NPM installed (or your package manager of your choice)
2. Place the navbar into the root of your project.
3. run `npm install` to install the package dependencies
